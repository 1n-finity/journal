                            <p>Our commitment to transparent science means we also encourage studies that may be overlooked by others, such as, studies with small sample sizes (when convincingly justified), replication research, null findings (provided this is not due to methodological shortcomings), and studies conducted by students and young researchers because we believe that every valid investigation regardless of its size or outcome contributes valuable insights to the cumulative and transparent process of scientific inquiry, fostering innovation and rigor.</p>
                       </p>This does not mean that such studies will be acceptable "automatically" for Publication. The same scientific quality criteria will be applied as they are established by the journal and means that implications from small sample size, replicative character and lacking statistical "significance" will have to be appropriately discussed.</p>
