  <details>
    <summary>Peer Review Policy</summary>
    <p>A manuscript will be reviewed for publication with the understanding that it is being submitted to Vivrtih Journal of Food Science and Clinical Nutrition alone at that point in time and has not been published anywhere, simultaneously submitted, or already accepted for publication elsewhere. Authors should authorise one of them to correspond with the Journal for all matters related to the manuscript. All manuscripts received are duly acknowledged.</p>

    <p>Our journal employs a double-blind peer review process to ensure fairness and objectivity. All submitted manuscripts are initially reviewed by editors for suitability for formal review. Manuscripts with insufficient originality, serious flaws, or a lack of a significant message are rejected at this stage. Manuscripts that are in the scope of the journal are also liable to be rejected at this stage.</p>

    <p>Manuscripts received from Editorial Board members will be screened by the Editor in Chief or other Associate Editors and sent to external peer reviewers. The editorial board members who are authors will be excluded from publication decisions.</p>

    <h3>Peer Review Process</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Manuscript Submission – Authors submit their manuscripts via the journal’s online portal or email.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Initial Screening – The Managing Editor checks for plagiarism and ethical violations, and verifies that the manuscript is within the journal's scope and follows submission guidelines.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Assignment to Associate Editors – The Managing Editor assigns manuscripts to the relevant Associate Editor or the Chief Editor based on subject expertise.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Peer Review Process – The Associate Editor assigns the manuscript to two qualified reviewers, or more when required. Reviewers evaluate the manuscript for scientific validity, originality, methodology, and clarity of writing.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Editorial Decision – The Associate Editor reviews the feedback and makes a final decision.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Copyediting & Publication – Once accepted, the manuscript undergoes copyediting for formatting and language and is then published online.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Review and Decision Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Relevance – The study must align with the journal's scope and focus.</li>
      <li>Originality/Contribution – The research should contribute novel findings, validate previous studies through replication, or present well-structured findings.</li>
      <li>Scientific Rigour – The methods, data, and analyses must be accurate and well-structured.</li>
      <li>Clarity – The manuscript should be well-written and logically organised.</li>
      <li>Ethical Integrity – The manuscript must adhere to ethical research and publishing standards.</li>
      <li>Constructive Feedback – Peer reviewers’ comments must be constructive and sufficiently addressed by the authors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Decision Thresholds</h3>

      <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> A manuscript requires at least two positive reviews for acceptance. Minor revisions may be accepted if reviewers find no significant flaws.</li>
      <li><strong>Revision:</strong> If at least one reviewer requests major revisions, the author must submit a revised manuscript addressing all concerns. This revised manuscript will undergo a second round of review before a final decision.</li>
      <li><strong>Rejection:</strong> A manuscript will be rejected if both reviewers recommend rejection due to fundamental flaws or ethical issues.</li>
