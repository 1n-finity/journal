                    <!-- Manuscript Types -->
                    <section class="section">
                        <h2>Manuscript Types</h2>
                        <div class="card">
                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Original Article:</strong> Present original research findings based on empirical data. These manuscripts should include a comprehensive analysis of a clearly defined research question or hypothesis, along with detailed methodology, results, and a discussion that contextualises the findings within the existing literature. Original Articles are expected to follow a structured format, including an Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References. The maximum word count is 6,000 words, with up to 50 references and a combined total of 8 tables and figures.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Review Article:</strong> Provide a critical and comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature on a specific topic within the journal's scope. These articles do not present new experimental data but rather analyse and interpret findings from multiple studies to summarise the current state of knowledge, highlight key themes, identify gaps, and propose future research directions. Review Articles should include an Abstract, Introduction, Main Text (organised into sub-sections), and a Conclusion. Submissions may contain up to 8,000 words, 100 references, and a maximum of 8 tables and figures combined.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Mini Reviews:</strong> Concise articles that focus on recent developments or emerging trends within a narrowly defined area of research. Unlike full-length reviews, Mini Reviews provide a snapshot of current knowledge, making them ideal for covering niche topics or rapidly evolving fields. Authors should aim to clearly synthesise key findings, offer critical insights, and identify areas for future inquiry. Mini Reviews typically range from 2,000 to 3,000 words, with a recommended reference limit of 40 and up to 4 tables or figures combined.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Short Reports:</strong> Brief yet impactful manuscripts that describe original research findings. These submissions are appropriate for studies that offer novel insights but may not require a full-length article. Short Reports should be focused, with clear objectives, concise results, and well-articulated implications. A standard format including an Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, and References should be followed. The word count should not exceed 3,000 words, with a limit of 25 references and a combined total of 3 tables and figures.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Case Study:</strong> Present detailed accounts of one or a few cases that illustrate rare, unusual, or novel clinical or food-related phenomena. These reports are valuable for sharing unique experiences or unexpected outcomes that contribute to the advancement of knowledge or practice. A Case Study should include an Abstract, Introduction, Case Presentation, Discussion, and Conclusion. Submissions should be between 1,500 and 2,500 words in length with references provided as appropriate and may include a reasonable number of tables, figures.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Protocol Papers:</strong> Describe the design and methodology of ongoing or planned research studies, such as clinical trials or public health interventions. These papers enhance transparency and reproducibility and allow for early peer input. A typical protocol should include the study rationale, objectives, design framework, recruitment strategies, data collection tools, and planned statistical analyses. Protocols should include an Abstract and structured sections covering the methodology. The word count should be between 3,000â€“4,000 words.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>White Papers:</strong> Authoritative documents that address significant challenges in food systems, nutrition policy, public health, or rural development. These papers are typically developed by experts or institutions and are meant to inform policy, guide practice, or propose strategic solutions. A White Paper should be well-structured with clearly defined sections such as Executive Summary, Background, Problem Statement, Analysis, Recommendations, and Conclusion. Submissions should range from 3,000 to 5,000 words and may include a reasonable number of tables, figures, and references as needed.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Policy Briefs:</strong> Evidence-informed documents intended to translate research findings into actionable recommendations for policymakers, institutions, or public health stakeholders. These submissions should address timely and relevant challenges within food systems, clinical nutrition, rural health, or public policy, with a clear focus on implications for practice or governance. A Policy Brief typically includes a structured presentation of the problem, relevant scientific evidence, policy context, and proposed actions or solutions. Submissions should use accessible language and may range from 1,500 to 2,000 words. Visual elements such as tables, infographics, or bullet-point summaries are encouraged to enhance clarity.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Educational Resources:</strong> Articles describe innovative teaching tools, community engagement models, or training methods related to food science, clinical nutrition, or public health education. These submissions are particularly valuable for educators, practitioners, and program developers working in academic, clinical, or community settings. Submissions should outline the development process, learning objectives, implementation strategies, and observed outcomes or feedback. Where applicable, authors are encouraged to include supplementary materials (e.g., worksheets, curricula, or links to digital content). Educational Resource articles typically range from 2,000 to 3,000 words and may include tables or figures to illustrate instructional models or outcomes.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Perspectives:</strong> Scholarly essays that explore conceptual, theoretical, or emerging issues in food and nutrition science. These articles allow authors to present well-reasoned arguments, propose new frameworks, or reflect on the evolution of ideas within the discipline. Unlike opinion papers, which are more personal and informal, Perspectives are academic in tone and grounded in literature. They can address intersections between science, policy, ethics, and culture, offering readers a broader understanding of complex or evolving issues. Perspectives generally range from 2,000 to 2,500 words, may include limited references and figures, and should not include an abstract.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Opinion Papers:</strong> Provide a platform for personal perspectives on key issues. These articles may cover controversial or emerging topics and are intended to stimulate discussion or offer fresh perspectives. Opinion Papers do not require an abstract and should focus on presenting clear, well-argued viewpoints rather than comprehensive literature reviews. The suggested word count is between 1,000 to 1,500 words. References and figures may be included where appropriate, but should remain minimal.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Commentaries:</strong> Short, focused articles that offer scholarly insight or critical perspectives on recently published articles, emerging trends, or key issues in food science, clinical nutrition, or public health. These submissions aim to provoke discussion, highlight alternative viewpoints, or clarify controversial or ambiguous topics. A Commentary may respond to a specific article published in the Vivrtih Journal or provide thought leadership on broader themes of interest to the readership. While brief in length, typically not exceeding 1,500 words, commentaries should be well-argued and supported by relevant evidence or citations. No abstract is required, and the inclusion of tables or figures is optional but should be limited.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Editorials:</strong> Generally solicited by the editorial board, though unsolicited submissions may also be considered. These concise articles offer insights, commentary, or reflections on relevant topics within the journal's scope. Editorials should not include an abstract and are limited to 1,200 words, with a maximum of 12 references and up to 2 tables or figures.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Letters to the Editor:</strong> Provide a platform for readers to share concise feedback, raise methodological questions, or offer alternative interpretations related to articles recently published in the journal. Letters may also address emerging issues in nutrition science, public health, or food safety. Submissions should be brief and focused, typically limited to 800 words and up to five references. Letters may contain a small number of clarifying data points, but tables and figures should be used sparingly or omitted entirely. These letters are subject to editorial review and may be sent to the original article authors for response.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Selected Summaries:</strong> Consist of brief, structured overviews of important research articles published in other journals. Authors must summarise the content in their own words and provide commentary on its significance, particularly in the Indian context. These pieces should include a summary followed by critical comments and should not exceed 1,000 words. No abstract, tables, or figures are required. The original article must be cited as the first reference, and a copy of it should accompany the submission.</p>
